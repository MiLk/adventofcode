Empty space is in (20, 6)
There is a wall of big disks between (15, 2) and (36, 2)

Move the space from (20, 6)  to:
* (20, 3)
* (14, 3)
* (14, 1)
* (35, 1)
* (35, 0)
This is 3 + 6 + 2 + 21 + 1 = 33  movements.
Move the Goal into the empty space (+1 movement).
35 times:
 * move the space in front of the goal (+4 movements)
 * move the goal into the space (+1 movement)
=> 33 + 1 + 35 * 5 = 209
